## PHP Advanced

PHP advanced introduces the advanced techniques in PHP programming to broaden and heighten further your PHP coding skills. 

It is designed for:

* Learners who have completed `An Introduction to Basic PHP Programming`, `Intermediate PHP Programming`, and `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP`.

* Individuals who have backgrounds in PHP programming.

* Experienced programmers who want to take a refresher.

In this course, you will gain an understanding of the essential topics for PHP advanced such as ternary operator, type hinting, session, cookies, exceptions, and error handling. 

You will learn by answering questions and writing your own code. We skipped the lectures so that you will have more time to practice. Go beyond learning the syntax and experience how PHP advanced works.
