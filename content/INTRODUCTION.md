## PHP Advance

PHP advance is designed for:

* Learners who have completed `An Introduction to Basic PHP Programming`, `Intermediate PHP Programming`, and `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP`.

* Individuals who have backgrounds in PHP programming.

* Experienced programmers who want to take a refresher.

In this course, you will be stepping into the advance level of PHP. The topics include ternary operator, type hinting, session, cookies, exceptions, and error handling. 

You will learn by answering questions and writing your own code. We skipped the lectures so that you will have more time to practice. Go beyond learning the syntax and experience how PHP advance works.
